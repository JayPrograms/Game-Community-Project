# Game-Community-Project
Created a full stack project to connect gamers to each other. Still a work in progress with some of the components like creating accounts, making blog posts, and adding friends are completed. Created using react.js for the frontend, node.js, graphql, and express.js for the backend, json webtokens for authorization, and postgresql for a database.
